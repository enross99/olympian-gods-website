        <p class="text-center">The pantheon of Greek gods consists of numerous major and minor gods and goddesses. The Olympians were the 12 principal deities who lived on Mount Olympus. They presided over all aspects of human life from the earth to things such as marriage and fertility.</p>
        <p class="text-center">Typically the Olympians consist of Zeus, Poseidon, Hera, Demeter, Aphrodite, Apollo, Ares, Artemis, Athena, Hephaestus, and Hermes. The twelfth Olympian is listed as either Dionysus or Hestia depending on where you look and who you talk to. Hades is also sometimes considered to be among the Olympians, but technically he is considered one of the Underworld deities. For this reason, you will find Hestia, Dionysus, and Hades listed along with the other gods below. </p>

                  <p class="card-text mt-2">Dionsysus was born to Zeus and Semele, the princess of Thebes. Common to Greek myths, Hera became furious that Zeus had been unfaithful once again. She tricked Semele into asking Zeus to appear in his true form which led to her death. Zeus took their unborn child and sewed Dionysus into his thigh, carrying Dionysus to term. Similar to Apollo, Dionysus was believed to have the power of revealing the future to mortals through the use of oracles. There were many temples and statues of Dionysus, and human sacrifices were ocasionally mentioned in older texts. </p>

                    <p class="card-text mt-2">Hestia was the first-born child of Kronos nd Rhea. She was the first to be swallowed by Kronos and thus the last to be disgorged. Due to this Hestia is named both the eldest and youngest of the six siblings. Both Apollo and Poseidon sought Hestia's hand in marriage, but she refused. Hestia then asked Zeus to allow her to remain a virgin forever which he agreed to. It is for this reason that sacrifices to Hestia were only cows that were one year old. As Hestia is the goddess of sacrificial flame, myth states that she received a portion of any sacrifice made to the gods.</p>
